# Visit Budapest

## Description
This website is a collection of useful links for anyone looking for tips when visiting Budapest, Hungary.
Simple, minimalist design and easy to use, you can find the links under each category name.
When the image is clicked it shows options and it takes you to the selected related website on a new tab.


## Custom CSS Classes
```
The IDs and classes I created are:

1. Class name: .nav-bar
I use this to wrap the unordered list of the navigation bar
I wrote media queries to format the nav bar depending on screen sizes

2. id name: overlay1-overlay6
I created these ids so I can use them in my JavaScript for each hidden content that becomes visible when the image is clicked on.

2. id name: cardtitle1-cardtitle6
I created these ids so I can use them in my JavaScript for Category/image name that disappears when the image is clicked (so the hidden content can appear instead).  
```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. function name clickedImage1.addEventListener('click'...
listens to user activity, when the image is clicked the title becomes hidden and the clickable content disappears

2. clickedImage2.addEventListener('mouseover'...
when we mouseover another image the original image's title reappears and the clickable content disappears


```
